this is a worldview
fame
think it through
guesthouse
add up
priest, pastor, minister
stereotype
He's dying with peace
illiteracy, poverty, pandemic disease
we started tithing.
it breaks the grip of materialism in my life.
Giving your life away.
notoriety
widow and orphan

is not to build your ego.

If you're wired to make deals, you make deals
